# Project 
My React Todo Web App

## Description
My version of The infamous Todo App. This app will allow the user to add items to their todo list, update and/or delete those items, as well as mark them completed. 

I wanted to incorporate many of the concepts I learned in bootcamp and I really feel the Todo app is a great way to showcase what I learned. What might seem simple is actually quite tough, from gathering the input of the user, tracking that inputs state, and being able to map/filter over the input as needed was a good challenge. 

I wanted to incorporate the ability of information to persist beyond the browser refreshing so I incorporated localStorage.

This project was scaffolded using Yarn create react-app.
